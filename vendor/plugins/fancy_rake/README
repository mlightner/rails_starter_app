fancy_rake
==========

Author: Matt Lightner

Inspired by the discovery of adding rake tasks for empty strings, I created a simple plugin that
lets you define arbitrary rake commands where the first component of the command indicates the
function to be performed, and the second is its argument (or possibly arguments).

For instance, running the following will find the string "< ActiveRecord::Base" throughout your app:

  $ rake f:"< ActiveRecord::Base"
    app/models/user.rb:1:class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    app/models/account.rb:1:class Account < ActiveRecord::Base


Supported features
==================

As of right now, the supported functions/features are "f" (find in app code) and "rt" (as in
"run test").  For the latter, you supply the name of a test in one of your unit, functional
or integration suites without the "test_" prefix and the correct test will be automatically
found and run.



Feel free to fork the projects and add functionality or enhance the architecture of the plugin!
